 To do (vaguely in priority order)
 ---------------------------------

* fix startup from webapp, first index page refresh often indicates
    'Done / 100%' before correctly showing 'Connecting to Peers'

* display seeds count when seeding (currently: 0 seeds) -- no clue how to get it
    (is it even supported? afaict when seeding, rTorrent shows 0 everywhere...)

* fix Makefile in -j1 mode (from a fresh tree "make -j2" works fine, but
    "make" fails the 1st time with error below, has to be run a 2nd time)
    make: *** No rule to make target `tfcli/.build/cmd_file.o', needed by `tfcli/.build/tfcli-libtorrent.full'.  Stop.

* in Makefile, detect & warn (and/or auto-adjust CXXFLAGS) if user is using a buggy gcc version?
    (http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/wiki/LibTorrentKnownIssues)

* .prio support

* test if .cmd open/unlink/.../read sequence works on NFS/Samba/...
    and if it doesn't, well... at least I'll be aware of it :p

* scrape (not sure it's supported in libtorrent... check further / look for a way to emulate it?)

* save/reload resume data and/or other libtorrent-private data to speed up restarts?
    (make sure stop / change .prio / restart is supported correctly, let's do better than tornado here)




 Done
 ----

* super-seeding (doesn't seem supported by libtorrent? look more carefully)

Not needed / supported, obsoleted by fast extensions (which aren't implemented yet)
  http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/ticket/801
  http://www.bittorrent.org/fast_extensions.html
  http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/ticket/237

* fix and further check stat-file reporting, includes at least:
    - when DownTotal == 0, use Size to compute Ratio
    - when stopped before completion, set Done to -100-Done

* up/down speed limits

* check seeds/peers reporting (not sure with all those peers_complete/connected/not_connected/accounted/...)

* --info mode

* get and log tracker errors (e.g. invalid passkey)

* .cmd support

* check order in which webapp writes commands in .cmd
    (e.g. avoid sharekill overridding a previous autodie)

Done, also a change in html/inc/iid/transferSettings.php (always send
  sharekill and runtime together, in that order -- not in trunk yet)

* fix link part of Makefile (either link statically if possible,
    otherwise look for a way to avoid that evil .so lookup in .)

* make default options sane (activate PEX, allow encryption, ...)

* find a way to avoid 'tracker error: Tried all trackers'
    message every announce interval (or at least mute it)

Muted (even rakshasa doesn't seem to want to touch that code, so I certainly won't :p)

* add an option to control encryption, sthg like:
	--encryption=none          encryption_none
	--encryption=accept        encryption_allow_incoming | encryption_prefer_plaintext
	--encryption[=active]      encryption_allow_incoming | encryption_try_outgoing | encryption_enable_retry
	--encryption=require       <active> | encryption_require
	--encryption=require-full  <require> | encryption_require_RC4
  default being <active>

* --create mode

* --create mode: add options for announce-list (multi-tracker), httpseeds
    (tornado web-seeding) and url-list (GetRight web-seeding)
