This is an experimental cli for libtorrent (http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/,
the core of rTorrent), written for integration with TorrentFlux-b4rt.

The cli is written to be usable outside tf-b4rt (as a classic, standalone
torrent client), or as a transfer client within tf-b4rt (which mainly means
it handles a few auxiliary files for communication with the webapp).

The command-line interface is 100% compatible with transmissioncli, except
for the following 3 options which are not supported: --scrape (-s),
--nat-traversal (-n) and --finish (-f).
[FIXME] actually that'll be true when I rename -s (--skip-hash-check)
        to not conflict with transmissioncli's -s (--scrape)
Additional options are supported, run the client with no args to see them.

See TODO file for features status.



  -------------------------------
  -- Building tfcli-libtorrent --
  -------------------------------

Just run make in this directory (GNU make is required).



  ---------------------------------------
  -- Integration with TorrentFlux-b4rt --
  ---------------------------------------

Note that this is an early prototype. NO SUPPORT for it (especially on how
to install / use it) will be given in the forum. You may try to catch me
(warion) in IRC, but I don't guarantee anything -- and don't expect a lot
more than what is written below.
If you want to try it out, you'll have to do a little work on your side.


If you already want to test integration within tf-b4rt, for now this client
should be almost usable in place of transmissioncli, with these exceptions
(this hasn't been tested, I don't guarantee it actually works):

- the transmissioncli-check (in admin / server) will fail (additional test
  added after 1.0-beta1 will detect it's not a real transmissioncli) -- so
  you'll have to disable that check or update the path in the db by hand.

- the client-start command-line must be altered to add "-Tv" (-T puts the
  client in tf-b4rt mode so that it handles .pid/.stat/.cmd files, -v makes
  it log a little info to get the same behavior as other tf-b4rt clients)
  in html/inc/classes/ClientHandler.transmission.php.

- scrape is not supported. Don't click on the Scrape tab. Ever. Don't say
  you haven't been warned.

- torrent creation is not supported yet.



  --------------------------
  -- Compile-time options --
  --------------------------

The following compile-time options are supported:

* TFCLILT_OPT_NO_QUICK_HASH: do not try libtorrent's quick-hash mode when
   starting transfers (this has nothing to do with option --skip-hash-check,
   which is always supported).
=> Quick-hash mode has no problems that I know of so this option is... useless.

* TFCLILT_OPT_NO_VARIABLE_FDSETS: do not use non-portable variable-sized
   fdsets -- you need this if your system requires you to compile rTorrent
   with option --without-variable-fdset (i.e. not with USE_VARIABLE_FDSET).
=> This option is not needed on Linux.
   [FIXME] no clue about *BSD
