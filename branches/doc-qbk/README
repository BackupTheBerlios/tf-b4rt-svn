This contains the source files and the generation system for torrentflux-b4rt's
HTML reference manual.

The source files, located in 'src/', are in QuickBook format:
	http://www.boost.org/doc/html/quickbook.html

When built, the HTML documentation is generated in 'html/'.


Requirements:
-------------

This system requires the following tools:
- 'xsltproc',
- probably the GNU version of 'make' (not tested with any other one),
- 'grep',
- 'wget',
- 'tar' supporting the '-j' option (bzip2),
- 'unzip'.


Howto:
------

To build the HTML documentation, all you need is to run 'make' in the root
directory containing this README file.

The 'make' system will perform the required steps in this list:
- download Boost, which includes the QuickBook tool and associated files,
- build Boost's build tool, named bjam,
    => at which point the build will voluntarily exit with an error, and you'll
       have to run it a second time (because of a GNU make limitation/bug).
       Don't worry, once bjam has been built, that doesn't happen again.
- download DocBook's XML DTDs and stylesheets,
- build the QuickBook tool,
    => this step can easily take several minutes, due to the amount of C++
       templates involved in compiling QuickBook.
    => also, this step outputs a few C++ warnings which can be ignored (they
       just look scary becase of all the templates involved).
- and finally generate the HTML documentation from its QuickBook sources.

Note that all these downloads and builds are performed inside this root
directory (i.e. nothing is downloaded/installed anywhere else).

    Details:
    --------

    'make' can be invoked with the following targets:
    - 'make boost':    force (re-)download of Boost,
    - 'make bjam':     force (re-)build of bjam tool,
    - 'make docbook':  force (re-)download of DocBook files,
    - 'make tools':    force (re-)build of QuickBook tool,
    - 'make doc':      build doc (default target),
    - 'make clean':    remove generated HTML documentation,
    - 'make cleaner':  'make clean' + remove QuickBook tool,
    - 'make cleanest': 'make cleaner' + remove Boost and DocBook.
