This is a raw Perl script, which does the gruntwork of converting a
text-file documentation (svn-trunk/doc/manual.txt) to QuickBook format.
(Raw meaning undocumented, badly written, ...)

It takes no args, reads from <manual.txt> and <tmpl.index.qbk>, and
generates <auto.qbk>.


Note that a slight change to input manual is needed. The separation between
TOC and contents:
	/**********************************************************************
	Introduction
	**********************************************************************/

must be changed to:
	***********************************************************************
	Introduction

(i.e. remove the star line below text, and no '/' at start).

Note that the script checks that sections order is consistent between TOC
and contents. If it is not, script dies with message "unterminated doc"
("waiting for" gives the section name which was found in TOC, but not
at the same place in contents).


The output QuickBook file contains:
- the hierarchical structure of the doc (qbk [section]/[endsect] pairs),
- for each section, its text contents with ordered and unordered lists
    transformed into their qbk equivalents.
The script also replaces all occurrences of "torrentflux-b4rt" by a
__proj__ qbk macro.
