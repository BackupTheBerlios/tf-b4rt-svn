Instructions

tfrss.pl is a simple script to help automate the process of downloading
torrents from an RSS feed based upon user specifed regular expressions.

How it works:
The user will specify all of the regular expressions (search terms) in the
filter-file (one item per line).  A cronjob will run the script at a
specified interval.

The script will download the rss feed.  Then, it will open the filter-file
and cycle through the regular expressions.  For each expression, it will make
a comparison with each torrent in the feed.

If a match is made, the history file is parsed looking to see if the torrent
has already been downloaded.  If it hasn't, the torrent is downloaded and is
added to the history file.


Note: This script has only been tested on the following setups :
* Linux 2.6.17 / 2.4.33.3
* Perl v5.8.8
  - XML::Simple perl module
  - LWP::Simple perl module
* torrentflux_2.1-b4rt-94 / torrentflux-b4rt-svn-trunk


Setup Instructions for manual setup with cron :

1. Place tfrss.pl in a directory of your choice.

2. Make tfrss.pl executable (chmod +x tfrss.pl).

3. Ensure a watch directory has been configured.

4. Add regular expressions to the filter-file.  Add only 1 expression per line.

   Example:

   debian
   Ubuntu
   freebsd.*release

   Note: The regular expressions are NOT case sensitive in this script
         (makes things a whole lot easier).

5. Create a cron job that runs the script at a specified interval.
   Please choose a sane interval and avoid hammering the feed.

   Usage :
    tfrss.pl rss-feed-url filter-file history-file save-location

   Where :
    rss-feed-url  : The fully qualified URL of the rss feed.
    filter-file   : path to the filter-file.
    history-file  : path to the history-file.
    save-location : The location you want to save the torrents to. (Should be
                    the same as your watch directory)

   Example :
    */15 * * * * /path/to/tfrss.pl http://www.example.com/feed.xml /usr/local/torrentflux/.tfrss/regex.dat /usr/local/torrentflux/.tfrss/history.dat /usr/local/torrentflux/.watch/
