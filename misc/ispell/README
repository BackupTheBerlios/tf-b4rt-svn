This folder contains an ispell resource file - .ispell - specific to the
torrentflux b4rt project.  Avoids the hellishly tedious job of skipping
word after word when ispell complains of all the tech words not in
regular dictionary!

To use it, copy to your ~ dir or set WORDLIST env vbl and then run
'ispell' on the files to be spell checked.
