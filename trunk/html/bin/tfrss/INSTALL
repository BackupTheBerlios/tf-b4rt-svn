TFRSS v0.1 Instructions

TFRSS is a simple script to help automate the process of downloading
torrents from an RSS feed based upon user specifed regular expressions.

Purpose:
The reason this script was written was to automate downloading tv torrents.
Other uses are possible, but haven't yet been considered.

How it works:
The user will specify all of the regular expressions (search terms) in the
regex.dat file (one item per line).  A cronjob will run the script at a 
specified interval.

The script will download the rss feed.  Then, it will open the regex.dat file
and cycle through the regular expressions.  For each expression, it will make
a comparison with each torrent in the feed.

If a match is made, the history file is parsed looking to see if the torrent
has already been downloaded.  If it hasn't, the torrent is downloaded and is
added to the history file.

Requirements:
Note: This script has only been tested according to the following
      requirements.

Linux kernel 2.6.17
Perl v5.8.8
	- XML::Simple perl module
	- LWP::Simple perl module
torrentflux_2.1-b4rt-94

Setup Instructions:
1. Place tfrss.pl in a directory of your choice.

2. Make tfrss.pl executable (chmod +x tfrss.pl).

3. Ensure a watch directory has been configured.

4. Add regular expressions to regex.dat.  Add only 1 expression per line.
   
   Ex:

   Lost.*HDTV
   The.Colbert.Report
   Stargate.Atlantis

   Note: The regular expressions are NOT case sensitive in this script 
         (makes things a whole lot easier).

5. Use a text editor to configure tfrss.pl the way you need it.

   $rssFeed - The fully qualified URL of the rss feed you want to monitor.
   $saveLocation - The location you want to save the torrents to. (Should be 
	the same as your watch directory)

6. $historyFile - The default is history.log. This will not show up until the
	first time a torrent is downloaded.  It's purpose is to keep TFRSS
	from downloading the same torrent twice.

7. Create a cron job that runs the script at a specified interval. Try not to 
	set it to run less than every 10 minutes to avoid hammering the feed.

   Ex:
	*/10 * * * * /path/to/tfrss.pl
