Installing
-----------------------------------------------------------------
*** Make sure the System Requirements are met.


1. Untar the package into a directory then copy the contents of
the "html" folder into your web site directory.

    tar -jxvf torrentflux<version>.tar.bz2

2. Create a database and load the mysql_torrentflux.sql script.
Database abstraction is supported starting in TorrentFlux 2.0
using ADODB for PHP.  You may specify type of database you want
to use in the config.php, but the examples here use MySQL.

    mysqladmin create torrentflux

"mysql_torrentflux.sql" contains the commands to build the table
structure and the default data for the TorrentFlux.  Run the
script on your torrentflux database.

    mysql torrentflux < mysql_torrentflux.sql
    Or load the script with PHPMyAdmin (web interface)

3. rename file config.db.php.dist to config.db.php and set the
database-settings to use your torrentflux-database.
You may specify type of database you want to use, but
the examples here use MySQL.

4. ensure the files+dirs in the docroot are readable by your
webserver-user. if it is not the case one possible solution is to
"chown" the files to your webserver-user. this may be done with a
line like that :
chown -R username /path/to/torrentflux-directory
change dir + username to fit your system so a possible line would
be :
chown -R www-data /var/www

5. IMPORTANT:  The first time you access the application, you
will be prompted for a user/password -- this is when you will
set the SUPER ADMIN user and password by what you enter.  For
example, you pull the site up for the first time, you will
be prompted to login and if you put in user: 'goombah' and
password: 'iama' then your super admin user account will
be set to goombah/iama -- cool?   You are ready to access
the application!

6. On your first login, you will be taken to the admin settings
page.  This is where you will check all your TorrentFlux
Settings (previous versions had these settings in the config.php)
At the top of this page is "Path" -- you will need to create
a directory with read/write permissions for TorrentFlux to use.
You can create a directory and chmod 777 it then specify this
path on the Admin Settings page.   When the path is valid and
writable, there will be a green light next to it.

While you are on the TorrentFlux Settings page, you may want to
verify that you have green lights down the page (if not you will
want to fix them).
