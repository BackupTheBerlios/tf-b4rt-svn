Installation with "setup.php"
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Untar the package into a directory then copy the contents of
   the "html" folder into your web site directory.

   tar -jxvf torrentflux-b4rt_1.0.tar.bz2

2. ensure the files + dirs in the docroot are readable by your
   webserver-user. if it is not the case one possible solution is
   to "chown" the files to your webserver-user. this may be done
   with a line like that :
   chown -R username /path/to/torrentflux-docroot
   change dir + username to fit your system so a possible line
   would be :
   chown -R www-data /var/www

3. ensure the dir "inc/config/" in your torrentflux-docroot is
   writable by your webserver-user.

4. open "setup.php" in a browser and complete it step by step.

5. IMPORTANT:  The first time you access the application, you
   will be prompted for a user/password -- this is when you will
   set the SUPER ADMIN user and password by what you enter.  For
   example, you pull the site up for the first time, you will
   be prompted to login and if you put in user: 'goombah' and
   password: 'iama' then your super admin user account will
   be set to goombah/iama.

   pages and configure your installation.
