/**********************************************************************
1. Introduction
**********************************************************************/

	Tfb is a web based transfer control client based on the popular
	torrentflux.  Tfb allows you to control your bittorrent transfers
	from anywhere using a highly configurable web based front end.

	Tfb is very easy to install on a webserver and includes a simple
	setup script which can be accessed from a web browser.  Just upload
	the files to your webserver, run the setup script and your tfb
	installation is ready to go.

	Tfb has builtin support for:

	- Original BitTorrent/Mainline: supports trackerless torrents and
	  encryption

	- BitTornado: uses slightly less resources than the original BT,
	  allows file priority for downloading files selectively

	- Transmission: much smaller memory footprint without too much loss
	  in functionality

	- wget and nzb (USENET/news server) transfers (wget must be
	  installed on your server)

	Tfb incorporates a huge number of advanced options to allow you
	finer grained control of your transfers. The administration panel in
	tfb includes a large number of options to allow you fine grained
	control over every aspect of your bittorrent/transfers usage.

	Tfb is also a multi-user application, allowing you to create
	individual accounts and assign restrictions to those accounts as you
	wish.


/**********************************************************************
2. Features
**********************************************************************/

	Some of the most popular features of tfb are listed below.  For a
	full list of tfb features, please see the FEATURES file.

	o Transfer statistics and logging:

		- View detailed torrent transfer statistics and information,
		  including:

			o per torrent error logging for easy troubleshooting
			o cumulative upload/download totals
			o number of seeders/leechers


	o Torrent control:

		- Perform stop/start/resume/kill/delete operations on individual
		  torrents, all torrents or a selection of torrents


	o Uploading of torrents:

		- upload single/multiple torrent files from your local machine
		  to the webserver

		- upload files directly to your webserver from another webserver


	o AJAX updates for maximum info with minimal bandwidth

		- Display of transfer lists can be easily configured to use AJAX
		  to update transfer stats in real time.  This saves on
		  bandwidth.

		- Individual torrent transfer windows can also use AJAX to
		  update stats in real time.


	o Support for a large number of additional third party
	  utilities/functionality, including:

		- archive file extraction from the browser (zip/rar)

		- vlc streaming controllable from browser

		- download of completed torrents directly from browser


/**********************************************************************
3. Requirements
**********************************************************************/

	Due to the extensible nature of tfb, there are a variety of 3rd
	party tools/utilities and extra functionality that can be enabled
	from within the administration control panel.  For this reason the
	requirements section is split into two parts:

		3.1 Minimum Requirements
		3.2 Additional/Optional Feature Requirements


/**********************************************************************
3.1 Minimum Requirements
**********************************************************************/

	This section lists the minimum requirements required to operate tfb
	with the basic core functionality.  This list may seem daunting, but
	most Unix like OSs have many of these features available as part of
	their software distribution system.

	/******************************************************************
	Notes:
	=====
	- The following lists are NOT exhaustive - if you use a Unix like
	  OS/webserver/database/etc not listed below, basic functionality of
	  tfb may well work.  Success reports on other OSs other than the
	  above are welcome on the forum:

			tfb-forum

	- IT IS STRONGLY ADVISED THAT YOU INSTALL THE COMPONENTS LISTED
	  BELOW FROM THE SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INCLUDED WITH YOUR OS
	  (ie apt-get, rpm package management, FreeBSD ports system, etc).
	******************************************************************/


	The core minimum requirements follow below:

	o A Unix like OS (no Win32 support).
	  Current tested OSs include:

		* Linux:
			o Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, RedHat, Fedora and others

			Note:
			=====
			SELinux should be turned off.

		* BSD:
			o FreeBSD, OpenBSD


	o A Web Server.
	  Current tested webservers include:

		* Apache
			- http://www.apache.org/

		* LightTPD
			- http://www.lighttpd.net/


	o An SQL-Database.
	  Currently Supported databases:

		* MySQL
			- http://www.mysql.com/

		* SQLite
			- http://www.sqlite.org/

		* PostgreSQL
			- http://www.postgresql.org/


	o PHP Version 4.3.x or higher with Session and PCRE support
	  enabled. Socket-Support is required for fluxd.

		- http://www.php.net/

		Notes:
		=====
		o Safe Mode must be turned off:
			* php.ini: safe_mode = Off

		o Allow Url fopen must be allowed:
			* php.ini: allow_url_fopen = On


	o Python is required for the BitTorrent and BitTornado
	  bittorrent clients:

		* Python >= 2.2 for BitTornado
		* Python >= 2.4 for BitTorrent Mainline
		  (original 'BitTorrent client).


	o Perl >= 5.6 or higher for fluxd, nzbperl.pl, ttools.pl and
	  fluxpoller.pl.  See section 3.2 below for extra info.

TODO


Support:
For support with your tfb installation please see the tfb forum:

http://tf-b4rt.berlios.de/forum/

Please take the time to search the forum first for a solution to your problem.  If you still can't find the solution after searching, please leave a clear and concise message stating:

a. The version of tfb you are using.
b. The problem that occurs and what you did to see the problem.
c. Ask a question and make sure the question doesn't require just a yes/no answer!  This sounds odd but saves a lot of time - asking 'is this broken?' will probably get you a 'yes' or 'no' answer - asking 'why does this happen when I do this/that/other?' will probably get you a better answer.
TODO: Add alternative options for support - ie superadmin/updates section?
