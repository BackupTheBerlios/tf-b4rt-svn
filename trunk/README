/**********************************************************************
1. Introduction
**********************************************************************/

	Tfb is a web based transfer control client based on the popular
	torrentflux.  Tfb allows you to control your bittorrent transfers
	from anywhere using a highly configurable web based front end.

	Tfb is very easy to install on a webserver and includes a simple
	setup script which can be accessed from a web browser.  Just upload
	the files to your webserver, run the setup script and your tfb
	installation is ready to go.

	Tfb has builtin support for:

	o Original BitTorrent/Mainline: supports trackerless torrents and
	  encryption

	o BitTornado: uses slightly less resources than the original BT,
	  allows file priority for downloading files selectively

	o Transmission: much smaller memory footprint without too much loss
	  in functionality

	o wget and nzb (USENET/news server) transfers (wget must be
	  installed on your server)

	Tfb incorporates a huge number of advanced options to allow you
	finer grained control of your transfers. The administration panel in
	tfb includes a large number of options to allow you fine grained
	control over every aspect of your bittorrent/transfers usage.

	Tfb is also a multi-user application, allowing you to create
	individual accounts and assign restrictions to those accounts as you
	wish.


/**********************************************************************
2. Features
**********************************************************************/

	Some of the most popular features of tfb are listed below.  For a
	full list of tfb features, please see the FEATURES file.

	o Transfer statistics and logging:

		- View detailed torrent transfer statistics and information,
		  including:

			o per torrent error logging for easy troubleshooting
			o cumulative upload/download totals
			o number of seeders/leechers


	o Torrent control:

		- Perform stop/start/resume/kill/delete operations on individual
		  torrents, all torrents or a selection of torrents


	o Uploading of torrents:

		- upload single/multiple torrent files from your local machine
		  to the webserver

		- upload files directly to your webserver from another webserver


	o AJAX updates for maximum info with minimal bandwidth

		- Display of transfer lists can be easily configured to use AJAX
		  to update transfer stats in real time.  This saves on
		  bandwidth.

		- Individual torrent transfer windows can also use AJAX to
		  update stats in real time.


	o Support for a large number of additional third party
	  utilities/functionality, including:

		- archive file extraction from the browser (zip/rar)

		- vlc streaming controllable from browser

		- download of completed torrents directly from browser


/**********************************************************************
3. Requirements
**********************************************************************/

	Due to the extensible nature of tfb, there are a variety of 3rd
	party tools/utilities and extra functionality that can be enabled
	from within the administration control panel.  Tfb also features a
	service daemon called Fluxd which can be used to schedule rss feed
	downloads, keep watch over running torrents and restart them if they
	die.

	The 3rd party utils/functionality and Fluxd all have their own
	requirements.  For this reason the requirements section is split
	into the following sections:

		3.1 Minimum Requirements
		3.2 Additional/Optional Feature Requirements
		3.3 Fluxd Requirements

	ALWAYS install the required items from the package installation
	manager for your OS whenever possible.  This will save a lot of time
	and headaches, and ensure all the dependencies are installed
	correctly. See your OS documentation for details about the software
	management systems available on your OS.


/**********************************************************************
3.1 Minimum Requirements
**********************************************************************/

	This section lists the minimum requirements required to operate tfb
	with the basic core functionality.  This list may seem daunting, but
	most Unix like OSs have many of these features available as part of
	their software distribution system.

	/******************************************************************
	Notes:
	=====
	- The following lists are NOT exhaustive - if you use a Unix like
	  OS/webserver/database/etc not listed below, basic functionality of
	  tfb may well work.  Success reports installing tfb on other OSs
	  other than those below above are welcome on the forum:

			tfb-forum

	- IT IS STRONGLY ADVISED THAT YOU INSTALL THE COMPONENTS LISTED
	  BELOW FROM THE SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INCLUDED WITH YOUR OS
	  (ie apt-get, rpm package management, FreeBSD ports system, etc).
	******************************************************************/


	The core minimum requirements follow below:

	o A Unix like OS (no Win32 support).

	Once more(!), it is highly advisable to install these requirements
	using the recommended package management system for your OS.


/**********************************************************************
3.2 Additional/Optional Feature Requirements
**********************************************************************/

	The following is a list of additional requirements needed before
	enabling additional features and options in tfb.  By default these
	options or features are disabled and can be enabled via the
	administration panel - please ensure the requirements are installed
	before enabling additional features.

	As mentioned above, it is strongly advised that these requirements
	are installed from your OS's software distribution system to ensure
	all dependencies are installed correctly.

	   * XML::Simple      (perl -MCPAN -e "install XML::Simple")



/**********************************************************************
3.3 Fluxd Requirements
**********************************************************************/
	The fluxd daemon works as part of tfb to run in the background on
	your server performing various tasks that you schedule.  Fluxd is
	started from the Administration control panel - by default it is not
	running.

	Fluxd is written in the Perl scripting language and requires a
	number of perl modules to run.  In the following list, the perl
	command is given for you to install the corresponding module from
	CPAN.  HOWEVER, most of these modules should be available from your
	OS's package management system and it is strongly advised that you
	install the modules from there rather than directly using the perl
	CPAN system.

	The required perl modules are as follows:

	o Core fluxd functionality:

		* IO::Select       (perl -MCPAN -e "install IO::Select")
		* IO::Socket::UNIX (perl -MCPAN -e "install IO::Socket::UNIX")
		* IO::Socket::INET (perl -MCPAN -e "install IO::Socket::INET")
		* POSIX            (perl -MCPAN -e "install POSIX")

	IMPORTANT:
	==========
	Additionally, Fluxd uses a PHP based helper script called
	fluxcli.php and for this to run correctly the commandline (cli)
	version of PHP must be installed with the correct extensions
	(database, PCRE and session support).  See the notes above in
	section 3.1 for more information.


	o (Optional) Fluxd database connectivity using Perl DBI - Perl DBI
	  db connectivity is not required to run Fluxd.  The option exists
	  to enable perl DBI however in the Admin panel.  The following
	  modules are required to run Fluxd in Perl DBI mode:

	   * all database-types:
		 DBI              (perl -MCPAN -e "install Bundle::DBI")

	   * MySQL:
		 DBD::mysql       (perl -MCPAN -e "install DBD::mysql")

	   * SQLite:
		 DBD::SQLite      (perl -MCPAN -e "install DBD::SQLite")

	   * PostgreSQL:
		 DBD::Pg          (perl -MCPAN -e "install DBD::Pg")


	o (Optional) Fluxinet functionality requirements - Fluxinet allows
	  local unix domain socket connections to Fluxd and is not enabled
	  by default:

	   * IO::Select       (perl -MCPAN -e "install IO::Select")

	   * IO::Socket::INET (perl -MCPAN -e "install IO::Socket::INET")


/**********************************************************************
4. Installation
**********************************************************************/

	Tfb can be installed quickly from a web browser using the included
	setup script.  For full details of how to install tfb manually,
	please see the INSTALL file.

	IMPORTANT:
	==========
	Before running the setup script, the tfb files must be copied to the
	webserver 'document root' folder.  It is highly recommended that you
	do this as the 'root' user in a shell so that the permissions on
	your tfb files can be set correctly for security and correct
	operation.  Login via SSH or telnet to your server and carry out the
	commands after running 'su'.

	It is possible to intall tfb without root access to your server - ie
	in a shared environment.  However be aware that running tfb in a
	shared environment is not officially supported due to the large
	number of features that tfb supports which require root or
	equivalent installation/configuration and maintenance.


	The installation guide follows below:

	1.	Download the latest tfb distribution tarball from:

		http://tf-b4rt.berlios.de/downloads


		In a shell:

		# Change to a temporary directory, make sure it exists first!
		root@users /root# cd tmp

		# Use wget to download the tarball
		# (EXAMPLE ONLY, PLEASE USE THE URL ABOVE TO GET THE LATESST TARBALL!):
		root@users /root/tmp# wget http://download.berlios.de/tf-b4rt/torrentflux-b4rt_1.0-alpha5.tar.bz2
		--12:23:20--  http://download.berlios.de/tf-b4rt/torrentflux-b4rt_1.0-alpha5.tar.bz2
		=> `torrentflux-b4rt_1.0-alpha5.tar.bz2'
		<snip>
		12:23:29 (212.19 KB/s) - `torrentflux-b4rt_1.0-alpha5.tar.bz2.1' saved [2038014/2038014]


	2.	Extract the distribution from the tarball in a temporary
		directory.


		In a shell:

		# Extracts the tarball into the temp directory
		# (EXAMPLE ONLY, CHECK THE NAME OF YOUR TARBALL!):
		root@users /root/tmp# tar jxvf torrentflux-b4rt_1.0-alpha5.tar.bz2
		torrentflux-b4rt_1.0-alpha5/
		torrentflux-b4rt_1.0-alpha5/sql/
		<snip>
		torrentflux-b4rt_1.0-alpha5/misc/check/
		torrentflux-b4rt_1.0-alpha5/misc/check/check_1.0.php


	3.	Copy the contents of the "html" folder into your web site
		directory (docroot).


		In a shell:

		# Change to the extracted tarball's directory:
		root@users /root/tmp# cd torrentflux-b4rt_1.0-alpha5

		# Recursively copy the contents of the 'html' folder to a folder
		# under your website docroot:
		root@users /root/tmp/torrentflux-b4rt_1.0-alpha5# cp -R html /var/www/html/tfb


	4.	Ensure the files and directories in the tfb directory under your
		website docroot are readable by the webserver user.


		In a shell:

		# Change to the docroot/tfb directory:
		root@users /root/tmp/torrentflux-b4rt_1.0-alpha5# cd /var/www/html/tfb

		# Change the ownership of all files under /var/www/html/tfb to
		# that of the user 'www'.  Change 'www' to the user your
		# webserver runs as:
		root@users /var/www/html/tfb# chown -R www:www /var/www/html/tfb



	5.	Ensure the "inc/config/" directory under your docroot/tfb is
		writeable by the webserver user and not accessible by others.


		In a shell:

		# Change ownership of inc/config/ so the 'user' group has write
		# access and the 'other' group has neither read, write nor
		# execute access:
		root@users /var/www/html/tfb# chmod u+w,o-rwx inc/config/


	6.	Finally, open "setup.php" in a web browser and complete it step
		by step.


		In a browser, browse to:

		http://example.com/tfb/setup.php


	IMPORTANT: LOGIN TO YOUR tfb INSTALLATION IMMEDIATELY
	=====================================================
	The first time you login/access the application, you will be
	prompted for a username and password.  This user/pass pair will be
	for the SUPERADMIN user on your installation of tfb.  If someone
	else browses to your tfb installation before you, they will be able
	to create a superadmin user and effectively 'own' your tfb
	installation.

	On your first login you should check all the admin settings pages
	and configure your installation.  Take the time to go through the
	options there to enable any features you require.


/**********************************************************************
5. Support
**********************************************************************/

	For support with your tfb installation please see the tfb forum:

		http://tf-b4rt.berlios.de/forum/

	Please take the time to search the forum first for a solution to your
	problem.  If you still can't find the solution after searching, please
	leave a clear and concise subject/message:

	1.	Ensure the subject of your message takes the format:

			[tfb-VersionXXX] Description

		where:

			VersionXXX is the version of tfb you are running.

			and

			Description gives a concise description of your problem.
			A message with a subject of 'HELP!!!' is NOT a good subject
			and is likely to be ignored.


	2.	Ensure the content of your message describes:

		a.	Your working environment if relevant

			- ie OS, PHP/DB/Python/etc

			(if in doubt, always include this info!)

		b.	A clear and concise description of what the problem is, what
			you did to see the problem and any additional info that you
			think might be relevant to helping you fix the problem.

		c.	What steps can be taken to reproduce the problem - this is
			useful to help others test your problem out.

		d.	A suggested fix for the problem if you think this is a bug -
			these kind of posts are always welcome!!!

			Please be very careful however before labelling something a
			'bug' before you are absolutely positive it is!


	3.	This is probably one of the most obvious important factors when asking a
		question on a technical forum but is surprisingly overlooked
		very often:

		MAKE SURE YOU ACTUALLY ASK A QUESTION!

		It's suprising how often people rock up on a forum with the
		intention of getting help, but they don't actually ask a
		question and only provide a load of information that leaves
		potential helpers thinking 'And.... the question is...?'!

		Also make sure you ask a question that doesn't just require a
		yes/no answer.  Before you actually submit the post, use the
		'Preview' feature to read over your message and check that any
		questions you ask won't be simple 'yes/no' answers (unless of
		course that's all you want!).


	TODO: Add alternative options for support - ie superadmin/updates section?
