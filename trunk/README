/**********************************************************************
1. Introduction
**********************************************************************/

	Tfb is a web based transfer control client based on the popular
	torrentflux.  Tfb allows you to control your bittorrent transfers
	from anywhere using a highly configurable web based front end.

	Tfb is very easy to install on a webserver and includes a simple
	setup script which can be accessed from a web browser.  Just upload
	the files to your webserver, run the setup script and your tfb
	installation is ready to go.

	Tfb has builtin support for:

	o Original BitTorrent/Mainline: supports trackerless torrents and
	  encryption

	o BitTornado: uses slightly less resources than the original BT,
	  allows file priority for downloading files selectively

	o Transmission: much smaller memory footprint without too much loss
	  in functionality

	o wget and nzb (USENET/news server) transfers (wget must be
	  installed on your server)

	Tfb incorporates a huge number of advanced options to allow you
	finer grained control of your transfers. The administration panel in
	tfb includes a large number of options to allow you fine grained
	control over every aspect of your bittorrent/transfers usage.

	Tfb is also a multi-user application, allowing you to create
	individual accounts and assign restrictions to those accounts as you
	wish.


/**********************************************************************
2. Features
**********************************************************************/

	Some of the most popular features of tfb are listed below.  For a
	full list of tfb features, please see the FEATURES file.

	o Transfer statistics and logging:

		- View detailed torrent transfer statistics and information,
		  including:

			o per torrent error logging for easy troubleshooting
			o cumulative upload/download totals
			o number of seeders/leechers


	o Torrent control:

		- Perform stop/start/resume/kill/delete operations on individual
		  torrents, all torrents or a selection of torrents


	o Uploading of torrents:

		- upload single/multiple torrent files from your local machine
		  to the webserver

		- upload files directly to your webserver from another webserver


	o AJAX updates for maximum info with minimal bandwidth

		- Display of transfer lists can be easily configured to use AJAX
		  to update transfer stats in real time.  This saves on
		  bandwidth.

		- Individual torrent transfer windows can also use AJAX to
		  update stats in real time.


	o Support for a large number of additional third party
	  utilities/functionality, including:

		- archive file extraction from the browser (zip/rar)

		- vlc streaming controllable from browser

		- download of completed torrents directly from browser


/**********************************************************************
3. Requirements
**********************************************************************/

	Due to the extensible nature of tfb, there are a variety of 3rd
	party tools/utilities and extra functionality that can be enabled
	from within the administration control panel.  Tfb also features a
	service daemon called Fluxd which can be used to schedule rss feed
	downloads, keep watch over running torrents and restart them if they
	die.

	The 3rd party utils/functionality and Fluxd all have their own
	requirements.  For this reason the requirements section is split
	into the following sections:

		3.1 Minimum Requirements
		3.2 Additional/Optional Feature Requirements
		3.3 Fluxd Requirements

	ALWAYS install the required items from the package installation
	manager for your OS whenever possible.  This will save a lot of time
	and headaches, and ensure all the dependencies are installed
	correctly. See your OS documentation for details about the software
	management systems available on your OS.


/**********************************************************************
3.1 Minimum Requirements
**********************************************************************/

	This section lists the minimum requirements required to operate tfb
	with the basic core functionality.  This list may seem daunting, but
	most Unix like OSs have many of these features available as part of
	their software distribution system.

	/******************************************************************
	Notes:
	=====
	- The following lists are NOT exhaustive - if you use a Unix like
	  OS/webserver/database/etc not listed below, basic functionality of
	  tfb may well work.  Success reports installing tfb on other OSs
	  other than those below above are welcome on the forum:

			tfb-forum

	- IT IS STRONGLY ADVISED THAT YOU INSTALL THE COMPONENTS LISTED
	  BELOW FROM THE SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM INCLUDED WITH YOUR OS
	  (ie apt-get, rpm package management, FreeBSD ports system, etc).
	******************************************************************/


	The core minimum requirements follow below:

	o A Unix like OS (no Win32 support).
	  Current tested OSs include:

/**********************************************************************
3.2 Additional/Optional Feature Requirements
**********************************************************************/

	The following is a list of additional requirements needed before
	enabling additional features and options in tfb.  By default these
	options or features are disabled and can be enabled via the
	administration panel - please ensure the requirements are installed
	before enabling additional features.

	As mentioned above, it is strongly advised that these requirements
	are installed from your OS's software distribution system to ensure
	all dependencies are installed correctly.

/**********************************************************************
3.3 Fluxd Requirements
**********************************************************************/
	The fluxd daemon works as part of tfb to run in the background on
	your server performing various tasks that you schedule.  Fluxd is
	started from the Administration control panel - by default it is not
	running.

	Fluxd is written in the Perl scripting language and requires a
	number of perl modules to run.  In the following list, the perl
	command is given for you to install the corresponding module from
	CPAN.  HOWEVER, most of these modules should be available from your
	OS's package management system and it is strongly advised that you
	install the modules from there rather than directly using the perl
	CPAN system.

	The required modules are as follows:

	o Core fluxd functionality:

	   * IO::Select       (perl -MCPAN -e "install IO::Select")
	   * IO::Socket::UNIX (perl -MCPAN -e "install IO::Socket::UNIX")
	   * IO::Socket::INET (perl -MCPAN -e "install IO::Socket::INET")
	   * POSIX            (perl -MCPAN -e "install POSIX")


	o (Optional) Fluxd database connectivity using Perl DBI - Perl DBI
	  db connectivity is not required to run Fluxd.  The option exists
	  to enable perl DBI however in the Admin panel.  The following
	  modules are required to run Fluxd in Perl DBI mode:

	   * all database-types:
		 DBI              (perl -MCPAN -e "install Bundle::DBI")

	   * MySQL:
		 DBD::mysql       (perl -MCPAN -e "install DBD::mysql")

	   * SQLite:
		 DBD::SQLite      (perl -MCPAN -e "install DBD::SQLite")

	   * PostgreSQL:
		 DBD::Pg          (perl -MCPAN -e "install DBD::Pg")


	o (Optional) Fluxinet functionality requirements - Fluxinet allows
	  local unix domain socket connections to Fluxd and is not enabled
	  by default:

	   * IO::Select       (perl -MCPAN -e "install IO::Select")

	   * IO::Socket::INET (perl -MCPAN -e "install IO::Socket::INET")

5. Support
**********************************************************************/

For support with your tfb installation please see the tfb forum:

http://tf-b4rt.berlios.de/forum/

Please take the time to search the forum first for a solution to your problem.  If you still can't find the solution after searching, please leave a clear and concise message stating:

a. The version of tfb you are using.
b. The problem that occurs and what you did to see the problem.
c. Ask a question and make sure the question doesn't require just a yes/no answer!  This sounds odd but saves a lot of time - asking 'is this broken?' will probably get you a 'yes' or 'no' answer - asking 'why does this happen when I do this/that/other?' will probably get you a better answer.
TODO: Add alternative options for support - ie superadmin/updates section?
