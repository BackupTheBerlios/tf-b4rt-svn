/**********************************************************************
Torrentflux-b4rt FEATURES file
**********************************************************************/

This file contains a comprehensive list of tfb features.  The features
list is split into various sections:

	1. Basic Usage Features
	2. Administration Configuration Options and Features
	3. Fluxd Server Configuration Options and Features

- Basic Usage

	o Multiple Transfer-Types with multiple Clients under a unified
      Frontend. The App-Suite can be used both via Web as via the
      commandline ("fluxcli.php").

	o Unified Transfer control:

		- Perform stop/start/resume/kill/delete operations on individual
		  transfers, all transfers or a selection of transfers

        - Changes Settings of running Transfers: Rates, Ratio, ...

	o Transfer statistics and logging:

		- View detailed Transfer statistics and information, including:

			o per transfer error logging for easy troubleshooting
			o cumulative upload/download totals
			o number of seeders/leechers

	o Upload + Inject of metafiles (.torrent, .wget, .nzb files):

		- upload single/multiple metafiles from your local machine
		  to the web server

		- upload metafiles directly to your web server from another
		  web server

        - multiple operations in "fluxcli.php" allow inject and more
          from command-line (cron, etc.)
          eg.: "inject", "watch", "rss"

	o fluxd

	o Web : Integrated Filemanager

	o Support for a large number of additional third party
	  utilities/functionality, including:

		- archive file extraction from the browser (zip/rar)

		- vlc streaming controllable from browser

		- download of completed transfers directly from browser

	o Web : AJAX updates for maximum info with minimal bandwidth

		- Display of transfer lists can be easily configured to use AJAX
		  to update transfer stats in real time.  This saves on
		  bandwidth.

		- Individual Transfer windows can also use AJAX to
		  update stats in real time.

	o Web : Templating Engine

		- the torrentflux-b4rt GUI is template driven using the vLib
		  template engine:

			http://vlib.clausvb.de/vlibtemplate.php

		  This allows developers to completely redesign the look and
		  feel of torrentflux-b4rt without having to worry about the
		  underlying PHP codebase.

		- Torrentflux-b4rt also incorporates template caching to speed
		  up the load time of pages.  This feature can be enabled via
		  the Administration control panel.

  o Upload Meta-files:
    - upload individual files from your local machine to the webserver
    - upload multiple files in one go from your local machine to the webserver
    - upload files directly to your webserver from another webserver

  o AJAX updates for maximum info with minimal bandwidth
    - Display of transfer lists can be easily configured to use AJAX to update
      transfer stats in real time.  This saves on bandwidth.
    - Individual Transfer windows can also use AJAX to update stats in real time.

  o Choice of BitTorrent clients to suit your needs - clients including:
    - Original BitTorrent/Mainline (supports DHT and encryption)
    - BitTornado (uses slightly less resources than the original BT, allows file
      priority for downloading files selectively)
    - Transmission (much smaller memory footprint without too much loss in
      functionality)

  o Individual Transfers 'remember' their own settings, allowing you to use
    different settings for different Transfers.

  o Control Transfers directly in the web browser:
    - start, stop, resume and delete individual transfers
    - start, stop, resume and delete discrete transfers in one operation -
      easily start/stop/resume all transfers in one go

  o View torrent Transfer information:
    - cumulative transfer statistics are available for every transfer in the
      transfer list. tfb keeps track of how much data has been transfered up
      and down even when you stop and restart the transfer.  This allows you to
      keep track of what your actual ratio is rather than what the current
      session ratio is.
    - logfiles are maintained for each and every torrent, allowing you to
      easily see when problems occur with your transfers.
    - current upload/download bandwidth rate as well as the number of
      seeds/peers and estimated time left is viewable in the transfer list
