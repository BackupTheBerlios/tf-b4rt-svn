**********************************************************************/

This file contains a comprehensive list of tfb features.  The features
list is split into various sections:

	1. Basic Usage Features
	2. Administration Configuration Options and Features
	3. Fluxd Server Configuration Options and Features

- Basic Usage
	o Transfer statistics and logging:

		- View detailed torrent transfer statistics and information,
		  including:

			o per torrent error logging for easy troubleshooting
			o cumulative upload/download totals
			o number of seeders/leechers


	o Torrent control:

		- Perform stop/start/resume/kill/delete operations on individual
		  torrents, all torrents or a selection of torrents


	o Uploading of torrents:

		- upload single/multiple torrent files from your local machine
		  to the webserver

		- upload files directly to your webserver from another webserver


	o AJAX updates for maximum info with minimal bandwidth

		- Display of transfer lists can be easily configured to use AJAX
		  to update transfer stats in real time.  This saves on
		  bandwidth.

		- Individual torrent transfer windows can also use AJAX to
		  update stats in real time.
  o Upload torrents:
    - upload individual files from your local machine to the webserver
    - upload multiple files in one go from your local machine to the webserver
    - upload files directly to your webserver from another webserver

  o AJAX updates for maximum info with minimal bandwidth
    - Display of transfer lists can be easily configured to use AJAX to update transfer stats in real time.  This saves on bandwidth.
    - Individual torrent transfer windows can also use AJAX to update stats in real time.

  o Choice of BitTorrent clients to suit your needs - tfb supports various clients including:
    - Original BitTorrent/Mainline (supports trackerless torrents and encryption)
    - BitTornado (uses slightly less resources than the original BT, allows file priority for downloading files selectively)
    - Transmission (much smaller memory footprint without too much loss in functionality)

  o Individual torrents 'remember' their own settings, allowing you to use different settings for different torrents.
    Universal settings available on a per-torrent basis:
    - Option to choose which BitTorrent client to use for each torrent
    - File priority - only download certain files from a torrent
    - Option to save each torrent to a specific location
    - Around 6 other options configurable as well as many more from the Admin settings, see below.

  o Control torrents directly in the web browser:
    - start, stop, resume and delete individual torrents
    - start, stop, resume and delete discrete torrents in one operation - easily start/stop/resume all torrents in one go

  o View torrent transfer information:
    - cumulative transfer statistics are available for every torrent in the transfer list.  tfb keeps track of how much data has been transfered up and down even when you stop and restart the torrent.  This allows you to keep track of what your actual ratio is rather than what the current session ratio is.
    - logfiles are maintained for each and every torrent, allowing you to easily see when problems occur with your transfers.
    - current upload/download bandwidth rate as well as the number of seeds/peers and estimated time left is viewable in the transfer list
