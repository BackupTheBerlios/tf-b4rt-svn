    distribution root folder.




    User operations

        Working with metadata files (.torrent, .wget, .nzb files)

        This section uses the term 'metadata files' to refer
        collectively to .torrent, .wget and .nzb files.

            Uploading metadata (.torrent, .wget, .nzb) files

                Uploading individual metadata files from your filesystem

                    To upload a metadata file from your filesystem:

                        1. Click on the 'Browse...' button next to the
                           text field labelled 'Select a Metafile for
                           upload (.torrent, .wget, .nzb):'.

                        2. Browse to the location containing the meta
                           file you want to upload, select the file and
                           click 'OK'.
                        3. Click the 'Go' button next to the 'upload
                           metafile' text field.

                        4. (Optional) To upload and start the transfer
                           at the same time, select 'Upload+Start' from
                           the drop-down list next to the filename text
                           field.

                Uploading multiple torrent files from your filesystem

                    To upload more than one torrent file at a time,
                    there are two options:

                    Javascript multi upload method:

                    1.  Enter the filename of the first torrent in the
                        filename field.

                    2.  Click the 'More...' link underneath the filename
                        text field.

                        A new filename text field will appear for you to
                        enter a new file to upload.  You can repeat the
                        above until you have the filenames of all files
                        you wish to upload.  When you're done, click
                        'Go' to upload all the files at once.

                    Multiple Upload page method:

                    1. Click on the 'Multiple Upload' link underneath
                       the 'Select filename for upload' text field.

                       You will be directed to a new page with a number
                       of empty filename text fields where you can enter
                       the names of the files you wish to upload.  When
                       all files are selected, click 'Go' to upload.

                    In both methods above, you can have the files upload
                    and start immediately by selecting the correct
                    option from the drop down list - 'Upload+Start'.

                Uploading metadata files from a URL

                    Metadata files (.torrent, .nzb and .wget files) can
                    be uploaded directly from a remote URL (http/ftp) to
                    torrentflux-b4rt.  This saves having to download the
                    file first and then upload it separately.

                    To upload a metadata file from a remote URL (ie
                    http://example.com/torrentfile.torrent):

                    1.  Enter the URL in the text field labelled 'URL
                        for the Torrent File:'.

                    2.  Click the 'Go' button next to the text field.

                    3.  (Optional) To upload and then start the
                        transfer, select 'Get File+Start' from the
                        dropdown list next to the URL field.

                    The same operation can be completed for .wget files
                    and .nzb files if enabled by the administrator.


            Downloading metadata files

                Metadata files that have already been uploaded to
                torrentflux-b4rt can be downloaded by clicking on the
                green down arrow to the left of the transfer list item.

                You will be prompted to save the metadata file to disk
                or open it with a suitable application if your browser
                is configured to handle the metadata file type.

                Example:

                This feature is useful for when you want to confirm the
                integrity of a torrent file that doesn't appear to be
                transferring correctly.  Just download the file by
                clicking the download button and then open the torrent
                file in a standalone torrent client.

                This way you can see whether the torrent is working as
                it should in a different torrent client and verify
                whether there is a problem with the client you're using
                in torrentflux-b4rt.

            Searching for torrent files

                Performing a search

                    To search for a torrent file:

                    1.  Enter the keywords you wish to search for in the
                        text field labelled 'Torrent Search:'.

                    2.  Select the torrent search engine you wish to use
                        from the dropdown list next to the text box.

                    3.  Click the 'Search' button.

                    A search will then be made for the keywords you
                    entered on the search engine you specified and the
                    results will be listed.

                    Click on the name of the torrent in the results list
                    to download the torrent file directly to
                    torrentflux-b4rt.

                Working in the search results page

                    The search results page lists all the torrents that
                    matched the keywords you searched for, including the
                    following information:

                        o Torrent name
                            - password protected downloads are marked
                              with a bold 'P'
                            - torrents which require you to register
                              first before downloading them are marked
                              with a bold 'R'
                        o Category
                        o Size
                        o Seeds
                        o Peers

                    Clicking on the torrent name will download the
                    torrent to torrentflux-b4rt.

                    Clicking on a category name will fetch a list of all
                    torrents in that category from where torrents can be
                    downloaded by clicking on them.

                    Seedless transfers can be hidden from the search
                    result list by clicking on the 'Hide Seedless' link.

            RSS feed torrents

                The RSS torrents page can be browsed by clicking on the
                link 'RSS Torrents' in the middle of the window above
                the transfer list/drivespace bar.

                An RSS feed item can be downloaded by clicking on it's
                name in the RSS feed list page.

                If you don't see any feed items on the RSS torrents
                page, contact your administrator to get the RSS feeds
                added.

                Note, the RSS torrents page does not download torrents
                automatically using RSS!  For this functionality you
                must use the Fluxd daemon's Rssad module.  See
                TODO:rssad_link for information on configuring this.

                IMPORTANT:
                ----------
                If you are unable to download the RSS feed item when you
                click on it, make sure that the item you're trying to
                download is actually a torrent file and not just a link
                to the page that contains the file.

                The RSS feed your administrator adds MUST be a 'direct
                download' feed.  This is a feed of torrent URLs which
                can be downloaded directly (instead of having to visit a
                'details' page first and then download the torrent from
                that page).


        Controlling transfers
            Controlling individual transfers
                Starting individual transfers in advanced mode

                    Click the icon with a single white arrow on a green
                    background - located next to the transfer list item
                    on the far left of the listing - to open the
                    advanced start window.

                    The transfer settings window will open on the
                    'Control' page.  On this page you can modify a
                    number of settings before starting the transfer.

                    Once any modifications to the settings are made,
                    click 'Run Transfer' to start the transfer running.

                    To close the settings window after starting the
                    torrent, check the checkbox named 'Close Window'.

                    To NOT run a hash check before starting a torrent,
                    check the checkbox named 'Don't check hashes'.  This
                    is useful for when you have a very large torrent
                    that you know has been downloaded fully already and
                    you don't want to spend a long time having the
                    torrent client rechecking the integrity of the
                    download before continuing on to seed the torrent.

                    For full information on changing a transfer's
                    settings see the section on
                    TODO_link:changing_transfer settings

                    Note:
                    -----
                    The start advanced icon is only visible if the
                    torrent has not already started or is not in the
                    process of stopping.  To verify this, look at the
                    status column in the transfer listing which will
                    tell you whether the transfer is starting, started,
                    connecting, seeding, leeching, stopping, stopped or
                    new.

                Starting individual transfers in quick mode

                    Click the icon with a double white arrow on a green
                    background - located next to the transfer list item
                    on the far left of the listing - to start a transfer
                    in 'quick' mode.

                    Starting a transfer in quick mode allows you to skip
                    the advanced settings window.  Instead, the default
                    client and settings configured by the administrator
                    will be used instead to start the transfer.

                    See the section on TODO_link:transfer_client_options

                Stopping individual transfers

                    Click the icon with a white square on a red
                    background - located next to the transfer list item
                    on the far left of the listing - to stop a running
                    transfer.

            Controlling multiple transfers using the multi-ops feature

                Overview

                    The multi-ops feature of torrentflux-b4rt allows you
                    to perform the same operation on more than one
                    transfer at a time.

                Using multi-ops

                    1.  Select the transfers from the transfer list that
                        you want to perform the multi-op on by checking
                        their checkboxes to the far right of the
                        transfer list.

                        Note - to toggle the selection of ALL transfers,
                        check the checkbox at the bottom of the transfer
                        list to the far right next to the multi-ops
                        dropdown list.  Unchecking this checkbox will
                        deselect all transfers.

                        This can be useful if you have a large list of
                        transfers and you want to perform a multi-op on
                        only 90% of the transfers.

                    2.  Select the type of multi-op you want to perform
                        on the selected transfers from the drop down
                        list located under the transfer list to the far
                        right.

                    3.  Click the 'Go' button to perform the chosen
                        multi-op on the selected transfers.

                        WARNING:
                        --------
                        You will NOT be prompted for confirmation to
                        perform the multi-op so be sure that you really
                        want to carry out the action before using the
                        multi-op feature!

                Available multi-op operations

                    The operations that can be performed using multi-ops
                    are listed below:

                    o   starting and stopping more than one transfer

                    o   deleting transfer metafiles
                        - ONLY the metafiles are deleted, any transfer
                          data downloaded will NOT be deleted with this
                          option.

                          Choose this option if you have yet to move the
                          transfer data out of the torrentflux-b4rt data
                          directory.

                    o   deleting transfer metafiles and data
                        - delete both the transfer metafile - ie
                          .torrent file etc - AND the transfer data.

                          Be careful when using this option, only use it
                          when you have no more use for the data that
                          has been downloaded.

                    o   resetting transfer totals
                        - reset any information stored about how much
                          data has been transferred for this transfer -
                          cumulative upload/download totals.

                          Only use this option if you don't need to know
                          about how much data has been transferred in
                          total for a transfer.

                    o   wiping transfers
                        - deletes any transferred data and resets the
                          totals for the transfer.

                          Be careful when using this option, only use it
                          when you want any transferred data removed.

                Overview

                    The transfer settings window allows fine grained
                    control over your transfers and access to detailed
                    statistics and logs.

                    The options available in the settings window will
                    differ according to the type of transfer and the
                    status of the transfer - if the transfer is
                    currently running or not.

                    The transfer settings window is primarily used to
                    modify the settings of a currently running transfer
                    'on the fly' and to view statistics and logging info
                    for the transfer.

                    The transfer settings window is also used to modify
                    the settings of a client / transfer when starting a
                    transfer in 'advanced mode'.  See
                    TODO_link:'Starting individual transfers in advanced
                    mode'

                            or stopped - to use this method.

                        o   Clicking on the 'Transfer Settings' icon to
                            the far right of the transfer item in the

                Viewing a transfer's hosts

                    The 'Hosts' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to view a list of the hosts currently
                    connected with respect to this transfer.

                    A host in this list may not necessarily be actively
                    transferring data to/from us.  A host can be
                    connected and just in the process of negotiating the
                    transfer of data.

                Viewing a transfer's scrape information

                    allows you to view the detailed logging information
                    for the current transfer.

                    The transfer log is the first place to look when
                    troubleshooting a problematic transfer.  In it you
                    will find all the information output from the
                    transfer client and errors relating to a problem are
                    often displayed there.

                Viewing a transfer's metadata details

                    The 'Details' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to view detailed meta information about
                    the current transfer - the transfer filename,
                    hashing info, details of what files/directories are
                    included in the transfer, transfer size and the
                    announce url for torrents.

                Viewing the files included in a transfer

                    The 'Files' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to see what files are included in a
                    transfer once complete.

                Changing settings for a transfer

                    The 'Settings' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to modify the settings related to the
                    current transfer.

                    If a transfer has already started, any changes made
                    to the settings can be sent to the transfer's
                    client 'on the fly' by checking the checkbox
                    labelled 'Send Changes to Client' (set by default if
                    a transfer is already running).  There is no need to
                    stop the transfer before making changes to a
                    transfer's settings.

                    The settings available for a transfer will differ
                    depending on the client chosen to perform the
                    transfer.  Not all settings are available for all
                    choices of client.

                Starting, stopping and restarting a transfer

                    The 'Control' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to start, stop or restart a transfer.
                    The available options available will differ
                    depending on the current status of the transfer.

                    When the transfer is currently stopped, the control
                    page resembles the 'Settings' page in that all the
                    settings are available for modification prior to
                    starting the transfer.

                    When the transfer is currently running, the control
                    page is limited to the stopping or restarting of a
                    transfer.

        Server statistics

            Transfer status lights

                The transfer status light for a transfer is displayed to
                the far left of the transfer list.  The colour of the
                transfer status light determines the current status of
                the transfer.

                The colours of the transfer status light are as follows:

                o   Black
                    - transfer is not running.

                o   Red
                    - transfer is running but no seeds are currently
                      available for the transfer.  If this status
                      persists you should check:

                        * the transfer log for any errors (see
                          TODO_link:Viewing transfer log files)

                        * the torrent's tracker is online

                        * your firewall is configured to allow
                          connections to/from the client

                        * the torrent actually has any seeds available
                          at all

                      It is also worth testing that the torrent works
                      correctly in another torrent client if the red
                      light status continues, although be sure that the
                      client you test in does not use Distributed Hash
                      Tables (DHT or 'trackerless') because this maybe
                      affect the results of the comparison test.

                o   Yellow
                    - transfer is running but there are less than two
                      seeds available.  This can indicate that a torrent
                      is not well seeded and if this status continues
                      you may need to find a better seeded torrent or
                      use a DHT/trackerless enabled client.

                o   Green
                    - transfer is running with at least two seeds.

            General frontend  'Good looking' statistics

                The 'Good looking' statistics are displayed to the top
                right of the torrentflux-b4rt frontend and include the
                following statistics:

                o	Download Speed- total download speed for all
                    running transfers

                o	Upload Speed - total upload speed for all running
                    transfers

                o	Total Speed - total upload + download speed for all
                    running transfers

                o	Connections - total network connections for all
                    running transfers

                o	Drive Space - total hard disk drive space currently
                    in use for the filesystem where torrentflux-b4rt
                    downloads transfers to

                o	Server Load - current server load averages of the
                    server.  A sustained load average of over 2 in each
                    of the three readings can be indicative of excessive
                    server load depending on the server role.

                Clicking on any of the links in the 'Good looking'
                statistics section will open up the 'Server statistics'
                page.

            Viewing detailed server statistics

                Overview
                    The server statistics page provides detailed
                    information on server status, including drivespace,
                    logged-in user, process, network and transfer usage.

                    The server statistics page can be opened using the
                    following methods:

                    -   Clicking on any of the links in the 'Good
                        looking statistics' section of the frontend.

                    -   Clicking on the 'Server Stats' link above the
                        drivespace bar towards the middle of the
                        frontend.

                Drivespace and 'who' statistics

                    This is the default view for the server statistics
                    page labelled 'all' in the drop down list labelled
                    'Type' at the top of the server stats page.

                    This view provides information about:

                    o   Current drivespace used on the filesystem where
                        torrentflux-b4rt downloads transfers to.  The
                        output is taken from the Unix command 'df'.

                    o   Currently logged in users on the server - ie
                        'real' shell users on the server that
                        torrentflux-b4rt is installed on.  The output is
                        taken from the Unix command 'w' or 'who'.


                Process statistics

                    This view can be set by selecting 'ps' from the
                    'Type' dropdown list on the server stats page.

                    The view displays information about any currently
                    running processes for each of the transfer clients
                    supported by torrentflux-b4rt.

                Network connection statistics

                    This view can be set by selecting 'netstat' from the
                    'Type' dropdown list on the server stats page.

                    The view displays information about any network
                    connections currently connected for any of the
                    supported torrentflux-b4rt transfer clients.

                Transfer statistics

                    This view can be set by selecting 'xfer' from the
                    'Type' dropdown list on the server stats page.

                    The view displays transfer statistics - ie amount of
                    bandwidth used - in a table.  Statistics are given
                    for bandwidth used for each user in total, over the
                    last month, over the last week and for the current
                    day.

                    A detailed breakdown of 'per user' or 'total'
                    transfer statistics can be viewed by clicking on the
                    links in the initial transfer stats page.  On this
                    detailed page you can view statistics for any single
                    day within the last 30 days.

            Opening the server monitor

                The server monitor can be opened by clicking on the
                'green light on a white background' image above the
                drivespace bar towards the middle of the frontend.

                The following information is displayed in the server
                monitor:

                    o	Download Speed
                    o	Upload Speed
                    o	Total Speed
                    o	Connections
                    o	Drive Space
                    o	Server Load
                    o	Transfers running
                    o	Transfers queued

                The server monitor is updated every 5 seconds by default
                - update interval can be changed in the (TODO_link:
                Setting the server monitor update interval) webapps
                admin section.

            Viewing an RSS feed of the transfer list

                An RSS feed of the transfer list can be displayed by
                clicking on the RSS icon (icon with orange background
                and white arcs).

                The RSS feed can be subscribed to in your feed reader,
                allowing another method for monitoring the status of
                your transfers.

            Viewing activity history

                The activity history can be viewed by regular users by
                clicking on the 'History' link in the top right
                navigation menu.

                The activity history page displays information about all
                activities performed by the user in the last 30 days.

                The history page is a good place to look when
                troubleshooting problematic transfers.

        Changing the frontend look and feel

            Reordering the transfer list

                The transfer items in the transfer list are reordered by
                clicking on the various transfer list column headers at
                the top of the transfer list.

                For example, to change the display of transfer list
                items so the oldest items are displayed towards the top
                of the list, click on the first transfer list column header
                (above the transfer status lights) marked with a '#'.

                The transfer list reordering options are as follows -
                clicking the mentioned column header will toggle the
                sorting:

                o   Order by date transfer added to torrentflux-b4rt
                    - click column header labelled '#'

                o   Order by transfer file name alphabetically
                    - click column header labelled 'Transfer File'

                o   Order by transfer owner
                    - click column header labelled 'User'

                o   Order by transfer size
                    - click column header labelled 'Size'

                o   Order by total downloaded
                    - click column header labelled 'T. Down'

                o   Order by total uploaded
                    - click column header labelled 'T. Up'

                o   Order by transfer status
                    - click column header labelled 'Status'

                o   Order by percentage completed
                    - click column header labelled 'Progress'

                o   Order by download bandwidth
                    - click column header labelled 'Down'

                o   Order by upload bandwidth
                    - click column header labelled 'Up'

                o   Order by number of seeders
                    - click column header labelled 'Seeders'

                o   Order by number of peers
                    - click column header labelled 'Peers'

                o   Order by estimated time left til completion
                    - click column header labelled 'Estimated Time'

                o   Order by type of transfer client
                    - click column header labelled 'C' - client types
                      are denoted as follows:

                        B: tornado
                        T: transmission
                        M: mainline
                        A: azureus
                        W: wget
                        N: nzbperl

                Note:
                -----
                The 'Enable sortable' feature must be enabled in
                the 'index' settings page in the admin section to allow
                reordering of transfers.

                The columns available in your transfer list may differ
                depending on how the administrator has configured the
                display of transfer lists.  See the section on TODO_LINK
                'Setting the default transfer list columns to display'.

                The transfer list columns can also be configured on a
                per user basis by modifying the user profile settings if
                the administrator has allowed profile management.
                See the section on TODO_LINK 'Changing what to display
                in the frontend'.
                Also see the administration section on TODO_LINK
                'Allowing users to use transfer profiles' for info on
                enabling or disabling individual user profile
                management.

            Turning AJAX updates on and off

                The transfer list can be updated automatically using
                AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML).  To turn on AJAX
                updates, click on the link 'Turn ON AJAX-Update' under
                the transfer list.

                The update text will change to:

                    'Next AJAX-Update in xx seconds'

                where xx is the countdown in seconds until the next
                AJAX update (default 5 seconds).  The timer will count down
                until it reaches zero, at which point the transfer list
                will be refreshed.

                To turn off AJAX updates, click on the link 'Next
                AJAX-Update in xx seconds' again.

                The AJAX update interval can be configured either globally
                by the administrator ('index' section of the admin
                pages) or individually on a per-user basis in the user's
                profile.

            Turning page refresh on and off

                The main torrentflux-b4rt index page containing the
                transfer list can be updated automatically using the
                HTML meta refresh method.  To turn on page refresh,
                click on the link 'Turn ON Page Refresh' under the
                transfer list.

                The refresh text will change to:

                    'Next Page Refresh in xx Seconds'

                where xx is the countdown in seconds until the next
                refresh (default 60 seconds).  The timer will count down
                until it reaches zero, at which point the page will be
                refreshed.

                To turn off automatic page refreshes, click on the link
                'Next Page Refresh in .. Seconds' again.

                The refresh interval can be configured either globally
                by the administrator ('index' section of the admin
                pages) or individually on a per-user basis in the user's
                profile.

                Note:
                -----
                Using the page refresh method, the whole page is
                reloaded - not just the transfer list.  This option is
                now largely deprecated in favour of the AJAX update
                method, which only updates the transfer list instead of
                the whole page and so uses up less bandwidth.

            Showing/hiding seeding torrents

                Clicking on the 'Hide Seeding Torrents' link under the
                transfer list will hide all currently seeding torrents.

                This is useful when you have a lot of transfers in the
                transfer list that are in the 'Seeding' state that you
                don't want to keep an eye on continually.

                This feature can be configured either globally in the
                'index' section of the admin pages or on a per user
                basis in the user's profile.

        Profile management

                user basis, including general user settings (password,
                default theme, language), what is displayed in the
                frontend, what cookies to use for cookie enabled sites
                and the option to create different transfer profiles for
                different transfer situations.

            External cookie management

                Overview

                    Torrentflux-b4rt can be configured to use HTTP
                    cookies when performing any operation that involves
                    a HTTP request with a website that requires cookies.

                    This is mainly used for downloading torrent files
                    from a private tracker that requires you to use
                    cookies for authentication.

                    The following sections describe how to use external
                    cookies with torrentflux-b4rt.

                How to obtain cookie information

                            that the site uses.

                            Common cookie variables used in torrent sites
                            are UID and PASS, although these will differ
                            from site to site.  See your torrent site FAQ
                            or Forum for more info.

                             --------

                Adding cookies

                    Enter the domain of the website you want to use
                    cookies for in the text field labelled 'Host:'.

                    Enter the cookie string you want to use in the text
                    field labelled 'Data:'.

                    Example:
                    --------

                    If the cookie variables you want to send are:

                    o   uid with a value set to '99'
                    o   pass with a value set to 'foobar'

                    then the cookie string would look like:

                    o   uid=99;pass=foobar;

                    Once the Host/Data fields are completed, click 'Add'
                    to add the cookie.

                    The cookie will now be used whenever you perform an
                    action that involves an HTTP request with the
                    domain.

                Editing cookies

                    Click on the 'Edit' icon next to the cookie you want
                    to edit.  On the resulting page, modify the cookie
                    as needed and click 'Update' when finished.

                Deleting cookies

                    Click on the 'Delete <domain>' icon next to the
                    cookie you want to delete.  This will remove the
                    cookie from the current user's profile.


            Transfer profile management

                Overview

                    The transfer profile management section is found on
                    the user's 'Profile' page.  Click the link 'Transfer
                    Profiles Management' to open the transfer profiles
                    management window.

                    A transfer profile is a pre-defined set of transfer
                    options which are saved under a transfer profile
                    name.  The transfer profile(s) can then be used at
                    a later date when you start a new transfer, saving
                    you the effort of having to manually go through each
                    of the settings for that transfer tweaking them to
                    suit the type of transfer you're performing.

                    Example:
                    --------
                    You use a private torrent tracker that requires you
                    keep at least a ratio of 1.05.  Rather than manually
                    go through the settings each time you start a
                    torrent for that private tracker, instead you can
                    create a transfer profile with the following
                    settings:

                    o   'Percentage When Seeding should Stop:' = '105'
                    o   'Max upload rate' = 0 - no restriction on upload
                        speed

                    Now each time you start a new transfer that uses the
                    private tracker, just select the profile from the
                    transfer settings window - the sharekill ratio
                    will automatically be set to 105 and there will be
                    no restriction on how fast you upload to leeching
                    peers meaning you should meet your ratio of 1.05
                    faster.

                Adding transfer profiles

                    To add a transfer profile, complete the form on the
                    transfer profiles management page and click the
                    'Add' button.

                    If you wish the profile to be available to all other

        Directory / file manager

            Overview

                The directory manager allows you to work with the files
                and directories within the torrentflux-b4rt download
                directory.  Regular users are limited to working with
                the files in their own download folder - administrators
                can access any files in any directory within the master
                download folder.

                A number of different operations can be performed on
                files within the directory manager, including:

                o	Deleting files and directories
                o	Renaming files and directories
                o	Moving files and directories out of the transfer
                    directory
                o	Making torrents
                o	Downloading files and directories
                o	Downloading files and directories as tar archives
                o	Streaming movie files using VLC
                o	Viewing NFO files
                o   Extracting archive files (zip/rar files)
                o   Checking the integrity of files using .sfv files

                Permission to perform these operations can be controlled
                globally by the administrator in the administration
                settings pages. TODO_LINK: Directory / File Management
                options (dir)

            Opening the directory manager

                The directory manager can be opened with the following
                actions from the torrentflux-b4rt frontend:

                o   Clicking the 'Directory' link in the navigation menu
                    at the top right of the screen

                o   Clicking the 'Directory List' link in the middle of
                    the screen

                o   Clicking on the folder icon to the left of a
                    transfer in the transfer list

                Once the directory manager is opened, directories can be
                browsed by clicking on folders.  To go 'up' a directory,
                click on the link '[Back Parent Directory]'.

                The available actions that can be performed on a file
                are listed to the right of the directory manager.  These
                actions will differ depending on the type of file.

                All files within a directory can be selected at the same
                time by checking the checkbox at the bottom right of
                the directory manager.  Checking the checkbox again will
                deselect all files.

            Deleting files and directories

                Individual files can be deleted by clicking on the icon
                with a white cross on a red background next to the file.

                Multiple files can be deleted at the same time by first
                selecting all the files you wish to delete and then
                clicking on the cross icon at the bottom right of the
                directory manager next to the 'select all' checkbox.

                You will be prompted for confirmation to delete the
                file(s) after clicking the cross icon.

            Renaming files and directories

                Files and directories can be renamed by clicking on the
                'Rename File/Folder' icon to the right of the file.  A
                window will open asking you to specify the name you wish
                to rename the file/folder to.  Complete this form and
                click 'Ok' to rename the file/folder.

                Note:
                -----
                Using this option, files and folder can only be renamed
                within the bounds of the master download directory.  To
                move files and folders *out* of the download directory,
                the 'Move File/Folder' action must be used. TODO_LINK:
                Moving files and directories out of the transfer
                directory

            Moving files and directories out of the transfer directory

                Files and directories can be moved out of the master
                transfer directory by clicking on the 'Move File/Folder'
                icon.  A window will open asking you to specify the
                destination directory in a drop down list and the final
                name of the file/folder within that destination
                directory.

                Note:
                -----
                The destination folders for move actions must be
                configured by the administrator.  Any destination folders
                configured by the admin will be listed in the 'Move'
                window dropdown box.  Without this configuration, the
                move folder action has little more effect than the
                'rename' action.

                For more info on setting a list of directories to move
                files/folders into, see: TODO_LINK: Setting a list of
                allowed folders to move transferred files into

            Making torrents

                A torrent file can be created for a file or directory by
                clicking on the 'Make Torrent' icon.  A window will be
                displayed prompting for the necessary details for the
                torrent:

                o   Client - the client you want to use to create the
                    torrent file.

                o	Torrent name - the filename you wish to give the
                    torrent file

                o	Announcement URL - the URL of the tracker which will
                    be hosting the torrent file.  Check your tracker's
                    website for info on what to use for this option.

                o	Announce List - a list of alternative trackers to
                    use for this torrent.  This option allows you to
                    provide redundancy in the event that one tracker is
                    unavailable.

                o	Piece size - the size of chunks you wish your
                    torrent to be distributed in.

                o	Comments - any comments about the content of the
                    torrent.

                o	Private Torrent - whether or not this torrent is
                    private.  If private, the DHT / trackerless option
                    will be disabled.

                o	DHT Support - whether to support Distributed Hash
                    Tables for so-called 'trackerless' support.  Using
                    this option will allow clients with DHT support to
                    seek out peers using DHT instead of depending only
                    on static tracker servers.

                Torrent file creation will commence when the 'Create'
                button is clicked.  If the 'Notify me of completion'
                checkbox is checked, the create torrent window will
                display details of the torrent created once complete.

                When the torrent file is created, it will be displayed in
                the torrentflux-b4rt frontend ready for starting as with
                any other torrent.

            Downloading files and directories

                Files can be downloaded in a web browser by clicking on
                the 'Download' icon to the right of the file in the
                directory manager.

                Complete directories can be downloaded as a tar archive
                by clicking on the 'Download as tar' icon to the right
                of the directory in the directory manager.  This action
                will first create a tar archive of the complete
                directory listing and then send this to the web browser
                for download.

                Note:
                -----
                Downloading directories as tar archives can take a
                considerable amount of time if the directory structure
                is very large.

            Streaming movie files using VLC

                Movie files can be streamed in real time from the server
                by clicking on the 'Stream Multimedia (vlc)' icon to the
                right of the file.

                This action will open a window with a form for you to
                specify the details for the streaming action.

                TODO: description of streaming with vlc.

            Viewing NFO files

                NFO files refer to a standard information file that
                contains pertinent information for a distribution or
                download, so-called because the file ends in .nfo.
                These nfo files can be viewed by clicking on the 'View
                nfo file' icon to the right of the file listing in the
                directory manager.

                The following file extensions are considered to be 'nfo'
                files by torrentflux-b4rt: .nfo, .txt, .log

            Extracting archive files (zip/rar files)

                Torrentflux-b4rt supports the extraction of zip and
                rar archive files.  To extract an archive file, click on
                the 'Unzip/Unrar' icon to the right of the file listing.

                A window will open prompting you for a password for the
                archive - enter the password here if applicable.  If
                there is no password as far as you know, leave the
                password field empty.

                Click 'OK' to extract the archive.

                Note:
                -----
                The extraction process may take a long time to complete
                if the archive is very large.  You may close the
                'Uncompress file' window once it has started, the
                uncompression process should continue in the background
                on the webserver.

            Checking the integrity of files using .sfv files

                SFV or 'simple file verification' files are often used
                by file distributors to check on the integrity
                of transferred files.  The sfv signatures on a
                transferred archive can be tested by clicking on the
                'Check sfv' icon to the left of the directory containing
                the sfv file.
