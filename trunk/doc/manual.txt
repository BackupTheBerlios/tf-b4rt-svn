    requirements, installation guide, features and author list, please
    see the README, INSTALL and FEATURES files located in the
    distribution root folder.




    User operations

        Working with metadata files (.torrent, .wget, .nzb files)

        This section uses the term 'metadata files' to refer
        collectively to .torrent, .wget and .nzb files.

            Uploading metadata (.torrent, .wget, .nzb) files

                Uploading individual metadata files from your filesystem

                    To upload a metadata file from your filesystem:

                        1. Click on the 'Browse...' button next to the
                           text field labelled 'Select a Metafile for
                           upload (.torrent, .wget, .nzb):'.

                        2. Browse to the location containing the meta
                           file you want to upload, select the file and
                           click 'OK'.
                        3. Click the 'Go' button next to the 'upload
                           metafile' text field.

                        4. (Optional) To upload and start the transfer
                           at the same time, select 'Upload+Start' from
                           the drop-down list next to the filename text
                           field.

                Uploading multiple torrent files from your filesystem

                    To upload more than one torrent file at a time,
                    there are two options:

                    Javascript multi upload method:

                    1.  Enter the filename of the first torrent in the
                        filename field.

                    2.  Click the 'More...' link underneath the filename
                        text field.

                        A new filename text field will appear for you to
                        enter a new file to upload.  You can repeat the
                        above until you have the filenames of all files
                        you wish to upload.  When you're done, click
                        'Go' to upload all the files at once.

                    Multiple Upload page method:

                    1. Click on the 'Multiple Upload' link underneath
                       the 'Select filename for upload' text field.

                       You will be directed to a new page with a number
                       of empty filename text fields where you can enter
                       the names of the files you wish to upload.  When
                       all files are selected, click 'Go' to upload.

                    In both methods above, you can have the files upload
                    and start immediately by selecting the correct
                    option from the drop down list - 'Upload+Start'.

                Uploading metadata files from a URL

                    Metadata files (.torrent, .nzb and .wget files) can
                    be uploaded directly from a remote URL (http/ftp) to
                    torrentflux-b4rt.  This saves having to download the
                    file first and then upload it separately.

                    To upload a metadata file from a remote URL (ie
                    http://example.com/torrentfile.torrent):

                    1.  Enter the URL in the text field labelled 'URL
                        for the Torrent File:'.

                    2.  Click the 'Go' button next to the text field.

                    3.  (Optional) To upload and then start the
                        transfer, select 'Get File+Start' from the
                        dropdown list next to the URL field.

                    The same operation can be completed for .wget files
                    and .nzb files if enabled by the administrator.


            Downloading metadata files

                Metadata files that have already been uploaded to
                torrentflux-b4rt can be downloaded by clicking on the
                green down arrow to the left of the transfer list item.

                You will be prompted to save the metadata file to disk
                or open it with a suitable application if your browser
                is configured to handle the metadata file type.

                Example:
                --------
                This feature is useful for when you want to confirm the
                integrity of a torrent file that doesn't appear to be
                transferring correctly.  Just download the file by
                clicking the download button and then open the torrent
                file in a standalone torrent client.

                This way you can see whether the torrent is working as
                it should in a different torrent client and verify
                whether there is a problem with the client you're using
                in torrentflux-b4rt.

            Searching for torrent files

                Performing a search

                    To search for a torrent file:

                    3.  Click the 'Search' button.

                    A search will then be made for the keywords you
                    entered on the search engine you specified and the
                    results will be listed.

                    Click on the name of the torrent in the results list
                    to download the torrent file directly to
                    torrentflux-b4rt.

                Working in the search results page

                    The search results page lists all the torrents that
                    matched the keywords you searched for, including the
                    following information:

                        o Torrent name
                            - password protected downloads are marked
                              with a bold 'P'
                            - torrents which require you to register
                              first before downloading them are marked
                              with a bold 'R'
                        o Category
                        o Size
                        o Seeds
                        o Peers

                    Clicking on the torrent name will download the
                    torrent to torrentflux-b4rt.

                    Clicking on a category name will fetch a list of all
                    torrents in that category from where torrents can be
                    downloaded by clicking on them.

                    Seedless transfers can be hidden from the search
                    result list by clicking on the 'Hide Seedless' link.

            RSS feed torrents

                The RSS torrents page can be browsed by clicking on the
                link 'RSS Torrents' in the middle of the window above
                the transfer list/drivespace bar.

                An RSS feed item can be downloaded by clicking on it's
                name in the RSS feed list page.

                If you don't see any feed items on the RSS torrents
                page, contact your administrator to get the RSS feeds
                added.

                Note, the RSS torrents page does not download torrents
                automatically using RSS!  For this functionality you
                must use the Fluxd daemon's Rssad module.  See
                TODO:rssad_link for information on configuring this.

                IMPORTANT:
                ----------
                If you are unable to download the RSS feed item when you
                click on it, make sure that the item you're trying to
                download is actually a torrent file and not just a link
                to the page that contains the file.

                The RSS feed your administrator adds MUST be a 'direct
                download' feed.  This is a feed of torrent URLs which
                can be downloaded directly (instead of having to visit a
                'details' page first and then download the torrent from
                that page).


        Controlling transfers
            Controlling individual transfers
                Starting individual transfers in advanced mode

                    Click the icon with a single white arrow on a green
                    background - located next to the transfer list item
                    on the far left of the listing - to open the
                    advanced start window.

                    The transfer settings window will open on the
                    'Control' page.  On this page you can modify a
                    number of settings before starting the transfer.

                    Once any modifications to the settings are made,
                    click 'Run Transfer' to start the transfer running.

                    To close the settings window after starting the
                    torrent, check the checkbox named 'Close Window'.

                    To NOT run a hash check before starting a torrent,
                    check the checkbox named 'Don't check hashes'.  This
                    is useful for when you have a very large torrent
                    that you know has been downloaded fully already and
                    you don't want to spend a long time having the
                    torrent client rechecking the integrity of the
                    download before continuing on to seed the torrent.

                    For full information on changing a transfer's
                    settings see the section on
                    TODO_link:changing_transfer settings

                    Note:
                    -----
                    The start advanced icon is only visible if the
                    torrent has not already started or is not in the
                    process of stopping.  To verify this, look at the
                    status column in the transfer listing which will
                    tell you whether the transfer is starting, started,
                    connecting, seeding, leeching, stopping, stopped or
                    new.

                Starting individual transfers in quick mode

                    Click the icon with a double white arrow on a green
                    background - located next to the transfer list item
                    on the far left of the listing - to start a transfer
                    in 'quick' mode.

                    Starting a transfer in quick mode allows you to skip
                    the advanced settings window.  Instead, the default
                    client and settings configured by the administrator
                    will be used instead to start the transfer.

                    See the section on TODO_link:transfer_client_options

                Stopping individual transfers

                    Click the icon with a white square on a red
                    background - located next to the transfer list item
                    on the far left of the listing - to stop a running
                    transfer.

            Controlling multiple transfers using the multi-ops feature

                Overview

                    The multi-ops feature of torrentflux-b4rt allows you
                    to perform the same operation on more than one
                    transfer at a time.

                Using multi-ops

                    1.  Select the transfers from the transfer list that
                        you want to perform the multi-op on by checking
                        their checkboxes to the far right of the
                        transfer list.

                        Note - to toggle the selection of ALL transfers,
                        check the checkbox at the bottom of the transfer
                        list to the far right next to the multi-ops
                        dropdown list.  Unchecking this checkbox will
                        deselect all transfers.

                        This can be useful if you have a large list of
                        transfers and you want to perform a multi-op on
                        only 90% of the transfers.

                    2.  Select the type of multi-op you want to perform
                        on the selected transfers from the drop down
                        list located under the transfer list to the far
                        right.

                    3.  Click the 'Go' button to perform the chosen
                        multi-op on the selected transfers.

                        WARNING:
                        --------
                        You will NOT be prompted for confirmation to
                        perform the multi-op so be sure that you really
                        want to carry out the action before using the
                        multi-op feature!

                Available multi-op operations

                    The operations that can be performed using multi-ops
                    are listed below:

                    o   starting and stopping more than one transfer

                    o   deleting transfer metafiles
                        - ONLY the metafiles are deleted, any transfer
                          data downloaded will NOT be deleted with this
                          option.

                          Choose this option if you have yet to move the
                          transfer data out of the torrentflux-b4rt data
                          directory.

                    o   deleting transfer metafiles and data
                        - delete both the transfer metafile - ie
                          .torrent file etc - AND the transfer data.

                          Be careful when using this option, only use it
                          when you have no more use for the data that
                          has been downloaded.

                    o   resetting transfer totals
                        - reset any information stored about how much
                          data has been transferred for this transfer -
                          cumulative upload/download totals.

                          Only use this option if you don't need to know
                          about how much data has been transferred in
                          total for a transfer.

                    o   wiping transfers
                        - deletes any transferred data and resets the
                          totals for the transfer.

                          Be careful when using this option, only use it
                          when you want any transferred data removed.

            Transfer settings window

                Overview

                    The transfer settings window allows fine grained
                    control over your transfers and access to detailed
                    statistics and logs.

                    The options available in the settings window will
                    differ according to the type of transfer and the
                    status of the transfer - if the transfer is
                    currently running or not.

                    The transfer settings window is primarily used to
                    modify the settings of a currently running transfer
                    'on the fly' and to view statistics and logging info
                    for the transfer.

                    The transfer settings window is also used to modify
                    the settings of a client / transfer when starting a
                    transfer in 'advanced mode'.  See
                    TODO_link:'Starting individual transfers in advanced
                    mode'

                Opening the transfer settings window

                    The transfer settings window can be opened by using

                            or stopped - to use this method.

                        o   Clicking on the 'Transfer Settings' icon to
                            the far right of the transfer item in the
                            transfer list.

                    A number of different 'views' or pages are available
                    in the transfer settings window, these are covered
                    below.

                Viewing general transfer statistics

                    The 'Stats' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to view the following information about

                            this ratio is reached'

                Viewing a transfer's hosts

                    The 'Hosts' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to view a list of the hosts currently
                    connected with respect to this transfer.

                    A host in this list may not necessarily be actively
                    transferring data to/from us.  A host can be
                    connected and just in the process of negotiating the
                    transfer of data.

                Viewing a transfer's scrape information

                    The 'Scrape' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to view the number of seeds vs leechers
                    for the current transfer in the form of a pie chart.

                    downloaded and the number of peers vs seeders.

                Viewing a transfer's log file

                    The 'Log' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to view the detailed logging information
                    for the current transfer.

                    The transfer log is the first place to look when
                    troubleshooting a problematic transfer.  In it you
                    will find all the information output from the
                    transfer client and errors relating to a problem are
                    often displayed there.

                Viewing a transfer's metadata details

                    The 'Details' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to view detailed meta information about
                    the current transfer - the transfer filename,
                    hashing info, details of what files/directories are
                    included in the transfer, transfer size and the
                    announce url for torrents.

                Viewing the files included in a transfer

                    The 'Files' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to see what files are included in a
                    transfer once complete.

                Changing settings for a transfer

                    The 'Settings' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to modify the settings related to the
                    current transfer.

                    If a transfer has already started, any changes made
                    to the settings can be sent to the transfer's
                    client 'on the fly' by checking the checkbox
                    labelled 'Send Changes to Client' (set by default if
                    a transfer is already running).  There is no need to
                    stop the transfer before making changes to a
                    transfer's settings.

                    The settings available for a transfer will differ
                    depending on the client chosen to perform the
                    transfer.  Not all settings are available for all
                    choices of client.

                Starting, stopping and restarting a transfer

                    The 'Control' page of the transfer settings window
                    allows you to start, stop or restart a transfer.
                    The available options available will differ
                    depending on the current status of the transfer.

                    When the transfer is currently stopped, the control
                    page resembles the 'Settings' page in that all the
                    settings are available for modification prior to
                    starting the transfer.

                    When the transfer is currently running, the control
                    page is limited to the stopping or restarting of a
                    transfer.
