            - covers advanced concepts such as fluxd operation (fetching
              rss torrents automatically, watching folders and uploading
              new torrents automatically) and running the fluxcli.php
              script from the commandline or cron jobs.

    For an overview of the capabilities of torrentflux-b4rt and
    requirements, installation guide, features and author list, please
    see the README, INSTALL and FEATURES files located in the
    distribution root folder.




    User operations

        Working with metadata files (.torrent, .wget, .nzb files)

        This section uses the term 'metadata files' to refer
        collectively to .torrent, .wget and .nzb files.

            Uploading metadata (.torrent, .wget, .nzb) files

                Uploading individual metadata files from your filesystem

                    To upload a metadata file from your filesystem:

                        1. Click on the 'Browse...' button next to the
                           text field labelled 'Select a Metafile for
                           upload (.torrent, .wget, .nzb):'.

                        2. Browse to the location containing the meta
                           file you want to upload, select the file and
                           click 'OK'.
                        3. Click the 'Go' button next to the 'upload
                           metafile' text field.

                        4. (Optional) To upload and start the transfer
                           at the same time, select 'Upload+Start' from
                           the drop-down list next to the filename text
                           field.

                Uploading multiple torrent files from your filesystem

                    To upload more than one torrent file at a time,
                    there are two options:

                    Javascript multi upload method:

                    1.  Enter the filename of the first torrent in the
                        filename field.

                    2.  Click the 'More...' link underneath the filename
                        text field.

                        A new filename text field will appear for you to
                        enter a new file to upload.  You can repeat the
                        above until you have the filenames of all files
                        you wish to upload.  When you're done, click
                        'Go' to upload all the files at once.

                    Multiple Upload page method:

                    1. Click on the 'Multiple Upload' link underneath
                       the 'Select filename for upload' text field.

                       You will be directed to a new page with a number
                       of empty filename text fields where you can enter
                       the names of the files you wish to upload.  When
                       all files are selected, click 'Go' to upload.

                    In both methods above, you can have the files upload
                    and start immediately by selecting the correct
                    option from the drop down list - 'Upload+Start'.

                Uploading metadata files from a URL

                    Metadata files (.torrent, .nzb and .wget files) can
                    be uploaded directly from a remote URL (http/ftp) to
                    torrentflux-b4rt.  This saves having to download the
                    file first and then upload it separately.

                    To upload a metadata file from a remote URL (ie
                    http://example.com/torrentfile.torrent):

                    1.  Enter the URL in the text field labelled 'URL
                        for the Torrent File:'.

                    2.  Click the 'Go' button next to the text field.

                    3.  (Optional) To upload and then start the
                        transfer, select 'Get File+Start' from the
                        dropdown list next to the URL field.

                    The same operation can be completed for .wget files
                    and .nzb files if enabled by the administrator.


            Downloading metadata files

                Metadata files that have already been uploaded to
                torrentflux-b4rt can be downloaded by clicking on the
                green down arrow to the left of the transfer list item.

                You will be prompted to save the metadata file to disk
                or open it with a suitable application if your browser
                is configured to handle the metadata file type.

                Example:
                --------
                This feature is useful for when you want to confirm the
                integrity of a torrent file that doesn't appear to be
                transferring correctly.  Just download the file by
                clicking the download button and then open the torrent
                file in a standalone torrent client.

                This way you can see whether the torrent is working as
                it should in a different torrent client and verify
                whether there is a problem with the client you're using
                in torrentflux-b4rt.

            Searching for torrent files

                Performing a search

                    To search for a torrent file:

                    1.  Enter the keywords you wish to search for in the
                        text field labelled 'Torrent Search:'.

                    2.  Select the torrent search engine you wish to use
                        from the dropdown list next to the text box.

                    3.  Click the 'Search' button.

                    A search will then be made for the keywords you
                    entered on the search engine you specified and the
                    results will be listed.

                    Click on the name of the torrent in the results list
                    to download the torrent file directly to
                    torrentflux-b4rt.

                Working in the search results page

                    The search results page lists all the torrents that
                    matched the keywords you searched for, including the
                    following information:

                        o Torrent name
                            - password protected downloads are marked
                              with a bold 'P'
                            - torrents which require you to register
                              first before downloading them are marked
                              with a bold 'R'
                        o Category
                        o Size
                        o Seeds
                        o Peers

                    Clicking on the torrent name will download the
                    torrent to torrentflux-b4rt.

                    Clicking on a category name will fetch a list of all
                    torrents in that category from where torrents can be
                    downloaded by clicking on them.

                    Seedless transfers can be hidden from the search
                    result list by clicking on the 'Hide Seedless' link.

            RSS feed torrents

                The RSS torrents page can be browsed by clicking on the
                link 'RSS Torrents' in the middle of the window above
                the transfer list/drivespace bar.

                An RSS feed item can be downloaded by clicking on it's
                name in the RSS feed list page.

                If you don't see any feed items on the RSS torrents
                page, contact your administrator to get the RSS feeds
                added.

                Note, the RSS torrents page does not download torrents
                automatically using RSS!  For this functionality you
                must use the Fluxd daemon's Rssad module.  See
                TODO:rssad_link for information on configuring this.

                IMPORTANT:
                ----------
                If you are unable to download the RSS feed item when you
                click on it, make sure that the item you're trying to
                download is actually a torrent file and not just a link
                to the page that contains the file.

                The RSS feed your administrator adds MUST be a 'direct
                download' feed.  This is a feed of torrent URLs which
                can be downloaded directly (instead of having to visit a
                'details' page first and then download the torrent from
                that page).
