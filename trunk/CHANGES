***** fixes *****

- various minor fixes in various parts

- spelling and typos in various strings

- fixed: endless-redirect-loop when db-config-file, setup- and upgrade-scripts
  are missing (3110)

- fixed: setup.php and upgrade.php login-checks (3109)

- fixed: when using filepriority the *.prio file was written incorrectly.
  (last folder was left out) (3074)

- fixed: transfer-control page always showed "Last used Settings" profile,
  instead of "default" if transfer had never been started before (3067)

- fixed: the links in transfer-list to transfer-window was set twice in all
  themes (<a><a></a></a>) (3063)

- fixes in Authentication Type "Form Auth + Cookie" (3052 + 3053)
  * flush users autologin-cookie when "performAuthentication" fails
  * flush users autologin-cookie when user changed password

- dtree.js: superfluous "</a>" was generated for root of file-prio tree (3033)

- fixed: transferlist-template: seed button was showing for non uploadable
  clients (3022)

- fixed: filemanager: access dot-dir via direct url (3011)

- fixes in AJAX-code (3005 + 3006 + 3008)
  * ajax silent-mode was not working properly because of missing {}.
  * added some checks so it is not possible to start an second update while
    first still not finished.
  * added an unload method, because it was possible to press F5 and before
    reloading was started, an ajax request could be started because timer was
	still running, which then produced errors in FF.
  * if ajax_update() was called the second time, the ajax_HTTPRequest existed
    already and so it aborted old request, which results in readystat = 0,
	which calls the Callback.
  * changed ajax_pageUpdate so it only updates the "span_update" if needed.

- superadmin pages: display webapp page-title, instead of always
  'torrentflux-b4rt' (2991)

  or server-monitor while a request was already in progress)

- fixed postgresql sql- and query-files (2952)
  (use signed 4-byte ints where signed 2-byte ints are not enough)

- fixed: "transmissioncli does not notice the tracker on shutdown" (2915)
  details: https://tf-b4rt.berlios.de/forum/index.php/topic,587.0.html

  * Fluxd.php: delay-load modules list

  (fluxd_Maintenance_trestart) was ignored, like it was always true (2867)

- clienthandler-stop: give transfer 1 more second time after waitForTransfer
  ("Possible Hung Process" was logged as "just after waitForTransfer" there
